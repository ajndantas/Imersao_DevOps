services:
  app:
    build: . # . (dot) means "use the current directory" as the build context. 
             # Docker will look for a Dockerfile in this directory.
    container_name: api # The container_name: api line in your docker-compose.yml file 
                        # explicitly sets the name of the container that will be created for this service 
                        # to api

    restart: unless-stopped # The restart: unless-stopped line in your docker-compose.yml file 
                        # tells Docker to automatically restart the container unless it was stopped manually.
                        
    ports:
      - "8000:8000" # The ports section in your docker-compose.yml file is used to map network 
                    # ports from the container to the host machine. The line - "8000:8000" means that 
                    # port 8000 on your local computer (the host) will be forwarded to port 8000 
                    # inside the container. This allows you to access any service running on port 8000 
                    # within the container (such as a web server or API) by connecting to localhost:8000 
                    # on your machine. This mapping is essential for making containerized applications 
                    # accessible from outside the Docker environment.
